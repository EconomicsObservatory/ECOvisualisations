Footnotes:

1. Figures for 2022 are based on provisional data. Figures for other years are based on final data.					
2. Pupils who meet the expected standard in reading, writing and maths (combined) are those who meet the expected standard in all three subjects. The expected standard in reading and maths is a scaled score of 100 or above. The expected standard in writing is a teacher assessment of 'working at the expected standard' (EXS) or 'working at greater depth' (GDS).					
3. Pupils who reach the higher standard in reading, writing and maths (combined) are those who acheive a scaled score of 110 or more in reading and maths and are assessed as 'working at greater depth' (GDS) in writing TA.					
4. Writing teacher assessment and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures from 2018 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the writing teacher assessment frameworks.					
5. All figures include LA maintained schools, academies and free schools. Excludes alternative provision and independent schools.											
6. All figures at national, regional and local authority level in the local authority underlying data include pupils with missing results, pending maladministration or where they have taken the test in the past. These pupils are excluded from figures in the national underlying data and national tables. As a consequence of these differences, figures in the national and local authority underlying data may not match.											
7. Figures for Isles of Scilly and City of London are based on a single school in each local authority and therefore figures have been suppressed.											
8. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole was created on 1 April 2019 from areas that were previously administered by the unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole, and the district of Christchurch. 2019 data is not comparable to previous years. Dorset was created on 1 April 2019 from the districts of Weymouth and Portland, West Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck and East Dorset. 2019 data is not comparable to previous years.											
9. Data is not available for 2020 and 2021 as assessments were cancelled in these years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
10. Users are advised to take care when interpreting writing and science teacher assessment measures and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures for the following local authorities, particularly when making comparisons over time or between local authorities: Barnet, Bath and North East Somerset, Bedford, Blackpool, Bradford, Cambridgeshire, County Durham, Croydon, Cumbria, Darlington, Haringey, Hillingdon, Kent, Lewisham, North Yorkshire, Oldham, Oxfordshire, Peterborough, Rotherham, Sefton, Shropshire, South Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Surrey, Telford and Wrekin, Torbay, Tower Hamlets, West Northamptonshire, West Sussex and Worcestershire. These areas have higher rates of missing teacher assessment in 2022 than other areas - see ‘Data quality’ section for further detail.
11. Science teacher assessment measures from 2019 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the science teacher assessment frameworks.
