Here you will find all the data visualisations and infographics attached to our articles published on the Observatory website. Each visualisation is published under an open source [MIT licence](LICENSE), and you are free to reuse/reproduce/redistribute, with attribution.  

Under **[articles](/articles)** each visualisation has their own folder, and within that folder you will find separate subfolder for the **data** (in `csv` format) , the **visualisation** (in `json`), and in some cases accompanying `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. 

## ðŸŒŒ Visualisations

We try to follow industry best-practices in data visualisation and try to establish our very own visualisation guidelines for all chart types. You can read about theese, as well as the tools we use in **[guidelines](/guidelines)** .

## ðŸ“Š Data

All of our chart data are published under their respective article subfolders, but on top of that we also operate the **[ECOdataHUB](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ecodatahub)**, where you will find a trove of data used in our articles and analyses, as well as interactive visualisation exploration interfaces. Whenever possible, we try to follow a [TIDY](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) format.
