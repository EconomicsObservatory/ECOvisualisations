# Economics Observatory Visualisation Repository  
Here you will find all the data visualisations and infographics attached to our articles published in the Observatory website. Each visualisation is published under an open source MIT licence, and you are free to reuse/reproduce/redistribute, with attribution.  

Each visualisation has their own folder, and within that folder you will find separate supfolder for the **data** (in `csv` format) , the **visualisation** (in `json`), and in some cases accompanying `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.
