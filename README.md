Here you will find all the data visualisations and infographics attached to our articles published on the Observatory website. Each visualisation is published under an open source [MIT licence](LICENSE), and you are free to reuse/reproduce/redistribute, with attribution.

## üåå Visualisations

We try to follow industry best-practices in data visualisation and try to establish our very own visualisation guidelines for all chart types. You can read about these, as well as the tools we use in **[üìêvisualisation guidelines](/guidelines)** .

### Structure

Under **[articles](/articles)** each visualisation has their own folder, and within that folder you will find separate subfolder for the **data** (in `csv` format) , the **visualisation** (in `json`), and in some cases accompanying `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. The naming convention for articles is `yyyy-mm-dd-<ARTICLE_ID>`. We try to maintain that `<ARTICLE_ID>` matches the `URL permalink` of the article from the website.

Each figure in the article is typically a separate visualisation and has their own (usually [Vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) or [Vega](http://vega.github.io/), but sometimes a [D3plus](http://d3plus.org/) or [eCharts](https://echarts.apache.org/)) `json` specification. We normalize the data and compile the visualisations using the **`parser.ipynb`** [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook.

- `raw` contains the original data, as we have received it from the author (depending on the circumstances, this might not always be public)
- `data` contains the normalised data and it is typically the output of the `parser`.ipynb
- `visualisation` contains:
  - a `<FIGURE_ID>.json` (or `.js` for the case of *D3plus* visualisations) file for each visualisation (typically one for each figure in the article)
  - an automatically generated `<FIGURE_ID>.HTML` file for direct embedding
  - whenever data compatibility issues are likely to arise, or the data cannot be formatted using simple data manipulation (e.g. *Vega* data transforms) *only*, we also generate a file ending in `_local.json`, where all data is stored as a static `Javascript Object` inside the `json` file (this is the *safest* but also the *slowest*)

### Embedding

Furthermore, we maintain a [`viewer.html`](/viewer.html) that can take a data source parameters as its URL hash. E.g. visiting [`https://economicsobservatory.github.io/ECOvisualisations/viewer.html#`**`articles/2021-04-14-a-year-in-the-uk-labour-market-whats-happened-over-the-coronavirus-pandemic/visualisation/fig5_absent_from_work`**](https://economicsobservatory.github.io/ECOvisualisations/viewer.html#articles/2021-04-14-a-year-in-the-uk-labour-market-whats-happened-over-the-coronavirus-pandemic/visualisation/fig5_absent_from_work) will open the viewer for Figure 5 of [this](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/a-year-in-the-uk-labour-market-whats-happened-over-the-coronavirus-pandemic) article. **This is the recommended way** for embedding our visualisations on other sites.

## üìä Data

All of our chart data are published under their respective article subfolders, but on top of that we also operate the **[ECOdataHUB](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ecodatahub)**, where you will find a trove of data used in our articles and analyses, as well as interactive visualisation exploration interfaces. Whenever possible, we try to follow a [TIDY](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) format. You can read about our data zen in [**üìêdata guidelines**](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ECOdataHUB/tree/main/guidelines).

If you discovered any bugs or have any specific suggestions or feature requests please use the [Issues](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ecovisualisations/issues) page.
